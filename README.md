Project Overview
The Express.js Car Management API is a web application designed to manage car items through a RESTful API. This project serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the capabilities of Node.js and Express.js in building server-side applications. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on car items stored in a JSON file, providing a practical example of how to handle data in a web application.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

To create a simple yet functional API using Express.js.
To implement CRUD operations for managing car items.
To demonstrate the use of JSON as a data storage format.
To provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API.
Features
Welcome Page: A simple HTML page that greets users and lists group members.
Data Retrieval: Endpoints to fetch car data from a JSON file.
CRUD Operations: Full functionality to create, read, update, and delete car items.
Error Handling: Basic error handling for file operations to ensure robustness.
Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing for server-side scripting.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
File System (fs): A built-in Node.js module that allows interaction with the file system, enabling reading and writing of files.
Path: A Node.js module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
JSON: A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
File Structure
The project is organized into the following structure:

File Descriptions
JSFile1.js: This file sets up a basic Express server and serves a welcome page that lists the group members.
JSFile2.js: This file contains an endpoint to retrieve car data from a JSON file, demonstrating how to read data from the file system.
JSFile3.js: This file implements the full CRUD functionality for managing car items, including endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting items.
